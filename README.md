## Overview
This repository contains presentations and reflections by Bryan Pierre on the use of Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer. The presentations cover topics related to Wireshark installation, network interface selection, packet observation, and insights into the Physical Layer of network communication.

### Week 1: Wireshark Installation and Data Link Layer
- **a. Installation Process and Challenges:**
  - The installation process was straightforward, following the official Wireshark website instructions. Challenges included the need to download chmod and a desire for more guidance on the appropriate version for my older MacBook model.

- **b. Network Interface Selection:**
  - Details about the network interface chosen for packet capturing are provided, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the capture environment.

- **c. Packet Observation:**
  - An overview of the types of packets observed, focusing on Ethernet frames as the most prevalent packet type at the Data Link Layer.

- **d. Interesting Observations:**
  - Identification of high levels of broadcast traffic, revealing constant checks for other Wi-Fi networks in the area.

- **e. Reflection on Wireshark's Usefulness:**
  - Wireshark proved invaluable for understanding Data Link Layer communication and troubleshooting network issues. Insights were gained into fundamental protocols, addressing schemes, and network behavior.

### Functions and Responsibilities of the Physical Layer
- **a. Examination of Signal Types:**
  - Analyzing protocol information in captured packets to identify signals such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

- **b. Transmission Media Analysis:**
  - Observing the types of transmission media (wired or wireless) by examining network interface details.

- **c. Error Detection and Correction Methods:**
  - Investigating captured packets for evidence of error detection and correction methods, such as checksums or parity bits.

### The Physical Layer Overview
- **a. Introduction to Physical Layer Functions:**
  - Briefly describing the responsibilities of the Physical Layer, including the transmission of raw bits and adherence to specified standards.

- **b. Analysis of Transmission Media:**
  - Discussion of observed transmission media types, including wired (copper or fiber optic) or wireless (radio or infrared).

- **c. Error Detection and Correction Discussion:**
  - Examining error detection and correction methods observed in captured traffic, such as checksums or parity bits.

### Conclusion
These presentations and reflections provide a comprehensive overview of Wireshark usage, from installation challenges to in-depth analyses of packet captures, offering insights into both the Data Link Layer and the Physical Layer of network communication.
